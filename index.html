                <br> 
                <br>
                <p> Hello and welcome!</p>
                <p> My name is Evan Leong and I'm currently a freshman at Cornell University's College of Arts & Sciences in Ithaca NY.
                <br>
                <br>
                    I'm also a prospective internal transfer student to Cornell University's College of Engineering and am taking coursework between both colleges
                    to pursue a Bachelors Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering!
                <br>
                <br>
                    If you want to continue learning about me, my academics, and projects that I'm working on or have worked on in the past, 
                    check out the featured and resume pages! 
                <br>

                <h1>About This Page!</h1>
            <p> This personal website was built entirely from the ground up with the above programs!  
                <br>
                <br>
                    I used Figma and Google Drawings to draft the layout of the website and create all the figures and images you see on the page, and then implemented the final design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    All the code for this website has been pushed from VSCode to a public Github repository that anyone can view as new content is added.*
                <br> 
                 
                <br>
                    This website was also developed and run entirely for free. From the hosting and SSL certification, to the domain name and drafting software, I wanted to challenge myself to make the most cost effective format as a proof of concept that it doesn't take much to build a platform to share ideas with the world!
                <br>
                <br>
                    My main goal however in building this website was to help people visualize and follow along with my journey in engineering. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    As I progress through my academic and professional careers, I hope to continue updating this website with any new information or accomplishments I attain along the way.
                <br>
