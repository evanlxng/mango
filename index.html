                <br> 
                <br>
                <p> Hello and welcome!</p>
                <p> My name is Evan Leong and I'm a freshman at Cornell University's College of Arts & Sciences in Ithaca NY.
                <br>
                <br>
                    I'm also a prospective internal transfer student to Cornell University's College of Engineering and I'm currently taking coursework between both colleges
                    to pursue a Bachelors Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    If you want to continue learning about me, my academics, and projects that I'm working on or have worked on in the past, 
                    check out the <a href= "featured.html"> Featured</a> and <a href= "updatelog.html"> Resume</a> pages!

                <h1>About This Page!</h1>
                <p> My main ambition in building this website was to help people visualize and follow along with my journey in engineering. 
                <br>
                <br>I wanted to create a way for people to not just keep track of how far I've come as a student and an engineer, but also to inspire others to pursue and reflect on their own goals and acheivments! 
                <br>    
                <br>In order to do that, I personally built this website from the ground up and entirely for free. 
                <br>
                    From the hosting and SSL certification, to the domain name and software used to draft and build these webpages, 
                <br>I wanted to challenge myself to pursue the most cost effective method of building a website to show that it doesn't take much to build a platform on the internet and share your ideas with the world! 
                <br>
                <br> So how did I do it? 
                <br>
                <br>
                    I used Figma and Google Drawings to draft the layout of the website and create all the figures and images you see on these pages, and then coded all the physical webpages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    All the code for this website has been pushed from VSCode to a public Github repository that anyone can view as new content is added!*
                <br> 
                <br>
                    As I progress through my academic and professional career, I hope to continue updating this website with any new information or accomplishments I attain along the way.
                <br>
