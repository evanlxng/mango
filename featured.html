                <p> - During the Summer of 2020, I collaborated with a friend to engineer and program an automated 3-stage water filtration system
                <br> using UV spectrum lighting to eliminate bacteria in drinking water for astronauts on the International Space Station.
                <br>
                <br>- Passed 4 rounds of competition to draft, build, and test the efficacy of the project with professors at the University of Toledo.
                <br>
                <br>- Awarded 3rd place in nationally ranked competition and the opportunity to present our project at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.  
                    
            <br>Below, you'll find a little portfolio presentation that showcases some of the highlights of our project and creation process.

            <p> Drafted and designed in SketchUp CAD a system of 3 garden beds for a student garden at Waite H.S in Toledo. 
            <br>Presented project ideas to a BSA committee and met with school administration to manage approval for the project. 
            <br>Self-Fundraised $200+ for raw materials for the project, and led a group of Scouts to build and put the garden beds in place.

        <h1> Foldable, Hybrid-Electric Skateboard (March-May 2021)</h1>
   </div>

   <div class= "thirdprojecttext"> 
       <p>- Designed from start to finish, a folding personal electric vehicle using Fusion360 and hand-tools.
        <br>- Mounted a 3D printed battery housing to a skateboard deck, and attached 2, 350 watt electric hub motors to power the skateboard.
        <br>- Iteratively tested and modeled the battery housing and lid in CAD before printing to minimize waste and optimize on cost. 
        <br>- In the 3D printing process, to optimize on time and for safety precautions , I set up OctoPi on my 3d printer.
        <br>- OctoPi is a software that runs on a Raspberry Pi unit that allows me to remotely control my 3D printer from anywhere on my home wifi to stop and start prints.
        <br> I can also monitor prints in real-time and ensure that I fix printing errors before they cause damage to my printer or spark a fire hazard.

        <h1> Cornell Electric Vehicles Drivetrain CAD (October 2021 -Present)</h1>
   </div>

   <div class= "thirdprojecttext"> 
       <p> - As a member of the drivetrain team, I've been working on redesigning and optimizing parts of the drivetrain in CAD. 
        <br>- Through mentorship and weekly workshops, I've been trained in using Autodesk Inventor CAD software to design and edit 3D models and assemblies
        <br> of automotive parts. In this training, I've specifically learned to design for manufacturability and clarity. 
        <br>- In addition, I've also been trained in creating machine shop drawings in Inventor to dimension and draw out parts that need to be machined in the machine shop.
        <br>
        <br> ------Below, you'll find some examples of the CAD on the competition vehicle that I'm working on right now for the Shell Eco Marathon!-------
        <br> ------ Currently, I'm resizing parts of the rear axle and the differential to accomodate for smaller bearings that I've sourced from Mc-Master Carr (3D, online parts database).------
